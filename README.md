## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is critical for businesses to retain customers and improve profitability. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn based on their service usage and demographic data.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `gender`: Gender of the customer
- `SeniorCitizen`: Whether the customer is a senior citizen
- `Partner`: Whether the customer has a partner
- `Dependents`: Whether the customer has dependents
- `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
- `PhoneService`: Whether the customer has phone service
- `MultipleLines`: Whether the customer has multiple lines
- `InternetService`: Type of internet service
- `OnlineSecurity`: Whether the customer has online security
- `OnlineBackup`: Whether the customer has online backup
- `DeviceProtection`: Whether the customer has device protection
- `TechSupport`: Whether the customer has tech support
- `StreamingTV`: Whether the customer has streaming TV
- `StreamingMovies`: Whether the customer has streaming movies
- `Contract`: Type of contract
- `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer has paperless billing
- `PaymentMethod`: Payment method
- `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly charges
- `TotalCharges`: Total charges
- `Churn`: Whether the customer churned

## Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
